                    <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend
                        for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and
                        artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
                        carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I
                        haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a 
                        refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

                    <p>Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 26. The interiors are done well with a mixture of modern age
                        designing with classic old school comfort.The place is divided into three areas basically which is the
                        indoor lounge, the outdoor and rooftop seating.The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone
                        to the restaurant where as the outdoor seating is comparatively more modern with Graffiti's and funky
                        wall frames.An ideal place to chill and relax.
